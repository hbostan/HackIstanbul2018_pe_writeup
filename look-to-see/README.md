# look-to-see

There is a shortened link in the file: `goo.gl/QT2crZ`
It redirects us to an inaccessible site. Specifically the to this url: 
```
https://www.inaccessible-servers.38022283.tokai.net.thisisnottherocketsciencejustlearntoseethedetails.com:8080/?id=your%20flag%20is%3A%204lw4y5l00k70s33
```

we can see our flag is in there `your%20flag%20is%3A%204lw4y5l00k70s33`. Lets url decode this. It gives us `your flag is: 4lw4y5l00k70s33`.
Our flag is `4lw4y5l00k70s33`.
