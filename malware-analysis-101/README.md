We are given a binary, sooo let's run it. It doesn't seem to do anything...
Hint says that our flag is in `host:port` format, so our binary probably connects to some other host. since `connect` is a system call let's run our program with `strace` to track system calls.

```
$ strace ./runme 
execve("./runme", ["./runme"], 0x7ffea938b360 /* 70 vars */) = 0
mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC|0x1000, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, 0, 0) = 0x7f1ecde77000
socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
connect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(62190), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.217.36.45")}, 16
```

And here it is, our program connects to `10.217.36.45` on port `62190`. So our flag is `10.217.36.45:62190`.
